# wp-backup

## Requirements
- WP-CLI
- Bash
- Crontab

## How it works
This shell script creates the directory `wp-backup/`, and makes the zip file that includes `plugins/` `themes/` `uploads/` `wordpress.sql`(Exported mysql data).
Also you can set the maximum number of zip files. This script will delete oldest zip file when file's number reaches the limit.


## How to use
1. Please place `wp-backup.sh` at underã€€your WordPress directory.
2. Set `BACKUP_NUM` that is Maximum number of backup files. Also change `BASE_DIR` to your WordPres's path.
3. Set crontab to schedule of backup.
